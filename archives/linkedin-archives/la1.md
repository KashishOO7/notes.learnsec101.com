# LA1

Sometimes during the conversations, we get confused or lost by the tone of our own voice and thoughts that misleads us to say or do things that do not align with our opinions or emotions.

We feel overwhelmed by the words we spoke, feels like they weren't even ours.

To get past this, we need to know what we want, what we know, and what we should do. Rather than always focusing on how other perceive us.

In Cybersecurity or any other career field, we need to create and make our professional network stronger than ever.

Even if we're skilled and intelligent but do not know how to sell our services or present ourselves in front of others, we'd be seemed worthless. In my last medium article, I insisted more on creating a personal brand. See, it's better to have a few loyal audience than 1000 people who will just ignore your work and mark it as spam.

If your personal brand is stronger, you'll get more opportunities and increase in luck.

"The more people know you and your worth, the more lucky you get."
