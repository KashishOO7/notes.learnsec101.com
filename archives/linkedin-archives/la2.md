We always had the access to certain parts of our brain that can help us hack our brain to manipulate the reality we live in.\
\
You know, in this vast network of human interactions our craving for TCP connections with other humans ignites the desire for reliable, established relationships.\
But sadly, many struggle even to establish basic UDP connections, failing to communicate effectively.\
\
If we can calm our mind, re-calibrate our attention span then we can surely learn to decipher the source code of human behavior that will help us to reform relationships with others.\
We could rewrite the scripts of our relationships, unraveling hidden comments in their source code.\
\
To establish a successful reverse shell from our current state of mind (the PRESENT payload) to our bright future, encryption is key. So that, no one can see what we're up to, what we're planning for our future.\
\
Revealing our plans in the plain sight is like injecting dopamine shots into the core of our head. That cheap pleasure is like one of the worst practices in the wild that we are practicing daily.\
\
Everyone who's trying to intercept our life can easily decode our plans and ambitions as they are not properly encoded .\
\
You know, reality is often what our mind sees rather than what actually exists in the moment. Your concept of reality is different than the others.\
\
You cannot change what happened to you but you can always the way you look at the change that happened to you.\
\
It won't take away the pain but it will take away the reason for the existence of the pain.\
\
Life cannot be understood but can only be lived the way it should be understood by the one who's living it.\
\
Merry Christmas ðŸŽ„
