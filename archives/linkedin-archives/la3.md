Wanted to share some tips I think might be helpful to you while learning to code.

Everyone says to stay consistent but regularly practicing and staying consistent is a challenging task because we need to remind ourselves why we're even doing this. So, in my opinion you should use your creativity to solve problems using code (no need to dig deeper, just observe. we're surrounded by problems). You can also automate simple or complex tasks using coding in python. Create games (basic to intermediate to advanced)

See, -> Curiosity will lead to the urge to learn more. -> Interactive/fun Learning will lead to obsession (make sure it's healthy) -> Obsession leads to Resilience -> Resilience leads to overcoming failing miserably.

Hence, you're doing good. All the best.

Some quick interactive tips:

1. Make handwritten notes of importance stuff, solve the code on paper before running it, this will help you figure out details in your understanding.
2. Teach others whatever you learn. Simply, sharing your knowledge and teaching your friends a topic you learnt will help you figure out your weak points.
3. Don't be harsh on yourself. A master was once a student (probably a weak one)
4. Failing to stay consistent will lead to overall failure sadly. (that you don't wanna be)
5. Keep on practicing. Yes, again. That's the secret ingredient. (but in good amount, over-practicing will lead to burnout. Don't)

Sorry to say but it's hard to find a supportive community of like minded people these days.

If you find one, stay in touch, be kind, supportive and helpful.

See, if you find this helpful then comment below your thoughts or anything you wanna. Disliked the whole stuff, again comment below. People should know what other people think. It's a networking platform.

Have a nice day ahead. üôè
