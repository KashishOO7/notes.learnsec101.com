What problems a fresher or a person in need of a job faces. How to overcome them. How to not get scammed. ‚ö†Ô∏è

A thread üßµ

You're a fresher and is desperately looking for a job. Actions you took/taking:

1. Posting on LinkedIn feed for job recommendation and help from fellow network.
2. Cold emailing/DM people and friends.
3. Replying to every job offer you hear/get or can get.
4. Not losing hope and continually trying.

What NOT to do:

Being desperate for anything can make us vulnerable to many forms of scams.

1. Do not blindly trust anyone you come in contact with.
2. Do not open attachments you received that claims to give you job/internship or interview without any prior notice or information.
3. Do not share a resume publicly that clearly shows your: Phone number, address, other sensitive info that you might not provide otherwise to anyone random.
4. Do not fill RANDOM forms you find on Google, especially LinkedIn, Facebook and somewhere. (that asks your personal info)
5. Do not fall for high packages that doesn't even ask for your qualifications or skills and they do not align with your experience. (it definitely sounds scammy. right?)

What can we do:

1. Level up your skills. practice. document your journey.
2. Create, expand your professional network.
3. Send personalized message to people on LinkedIn (show genuine interest in their work, just don't pretend anything, interact with their posts on LinkedIn and all)
4. Don't yell "how worthy of a job you are. instead prove your worth to everyone".
5. Use creativity to create projects. (Pick a problem, solve it, and document your solution and journey)

We humans don't really get what we deserve but surely get more than what we deserve.

Work on yourself and help others build themselves. It will help you in the long run.

Never forget even that person who helped you solve your bug or gave you feedback on your work. Empathy!
