# How and why?

CTF or capture the flag are gamified activities to learn cybersecurity without getting bored that provides us hands-on experience.&#x20;

It’s really fun. I won’t bore you by convincing you to try CTFs. Instead I’ll provide you a YouTube [video ](https://youtu.be/u4u6ob13s2c?si=vi71sac78-R9-SFh\&t=98)that can explain you better. Anyway you came here, then there must be something that made you want to try CTFs.

Some cool International CTFs Videos I found: [Google CTF Finals 2019!](https://youtu.be/PBvthC7soS4?si=soaB-PC6VdCZxJMI) , [Real World CTF Finals](https://youtu.be/2S\_TXaGYD8E?si=Jp7zD6BtUSypK5B\_)
