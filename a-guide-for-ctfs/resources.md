{% hint style="info" %}
Stuck on a Challenge?&#x20;

Look for the solution only after you have at least spent 30 minutes on that particular challenge.&#x20;

* Make notes of every methodology and tips/tricks you learned or came across
* Don't look and follow the solution straightaway, instead after being stuck, look/read the solution then try again don't copy paste the solution.
* Cheating and getting the right answer will only hurt you and no one else.
