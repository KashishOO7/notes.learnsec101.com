There are so many resources out there that I can't share everything. So, use this to look for your needs [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q) (type bug bounty, red teaming, blue teaming, malware analysis, etc) Learn to filter out waste and useless info. Not everything is useful but you will learn something for sure.



PS. Don't limit yourself only to these, do your own research as well.

Will update this repo with time.
